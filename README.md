## Practical Use Cases for Code
- push()
  - Push () can be a great technique to expand arrays when it needs to dynamically grow as new data is received.
- pop()
  - pop () is an easy technique to get rid of the last element in an array. When you no longer require a component of the array and want to shorten it, this can be useful.
- concat() 
  - Concat () is great as it makes code more concise if you combine numerous arrays or values in a single line.
- Object.values()
  - Using Object.values() can be useful as it makes it simple to extract and display property values while debugging or logging objects.
- Object.keys()
  - When determining whether an object contains a particular property, use Object.keys().
- Object.freeze()
  - This can be useful to prevent any unwanted modifications to certain objects. It can be essential in some systems that require high levels of security. These Objects are locked down to avoid tampering when they are frozen.
